    title: "15-112 Term Project: Rhythm Maker",
    startDate: "10/2024",
    endDate: "12/2024",
    shortDescription:
      "Create, save, and play your own beatmaps for a collection of songs in Rhythm Maker!",
    fullDescription: `A simple rhythm game coded in Python for my 15-112 term project. The professors warned us 
                    in lecture about rhythm games, as even a bit of lag or imprecisiion could throw off the whole thing, 
                    but by that time, I had already decided I wanted to make one.
                    \nI used Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage! as inspiration for the style of the game, with notes appearing
                    larger as they are closer to the goal line. I decided to focus a lot more on the mechanics of the game
                    rather than the visuals; specifically, I used a running timer to precisely record the "spawn times" of 
                    the notes, and create them when a map is played. 
                    \nOverall, this was my first full coding project, and I'm mostly satisfied with how it turned out! I do
                    think I should have put more polish in the visuals, but I'll work on that in future projects :)`,

    shortDescription: "A simple platformer game engine, made in 24 hours.",
    fullDescription: `A platformer-maker made for 15-112's Python-only hackathon, Hack112. My friend and I entered as a group
                    of two among groups of 3-4. We took some time to discuss our ideas for what to make, and then
                    stayed up all night to implement our idea. 
                    \nMy focus was on character movement and the level-creator functionality. It took trial and error 
                    to find the right constants to make the controls and gravity feel intuitive. One especially tricky
                    part was making the player interact correctly with platforms. The constant effect of gravity, and
                    the player's jumping and movement meant there were a lot of kinks to work out in deciding where the
                    player could go. Managed to get it working somewhere around 4 in the morning :) 
                    \nThough we didn't win any prizes, I think I gained valuable experience for working 
                    on a short timeline to ideate, plan, code, and present a product.`,
